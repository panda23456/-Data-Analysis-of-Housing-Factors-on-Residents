My project investigates how various housing factors, such as location, type, size, and accessibility, influence the living experiences and satisfaction of residents. By analyzing data from surveys, interviews, and housing records, the project aims to identify key trends and correlations between housing conditions and residents' quality of life. The findings could guide urban planners, policymakers, and stakeholders in creating more resident-focused housing solutions.
